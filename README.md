# SuperPixelGrid
Lab for exploring 2D arrays.  Comes with an executable jar (verified under Java 8) to illustrate how the finished tool is intended to function.

Version 2 requires Princeton University's Standard Libraries (Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne).  A single jar file, stdlib.jar, may be downloaded from https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/ and placed on the classpath.  More information is available on the link.
